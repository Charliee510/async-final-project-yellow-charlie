## Dataset
The impacts of phone addictions 

## Why did I chose this dataset?

Recently, I started to care about my mental health. Getting enough sleep, trying to sleep for most of 7 hours, and avoiding social media in my free time, or at least limiting usage to an hour a day. I used to spend a lot my time on social media specifically tiktok, watching short time content day to night and it affected my mental health where it had shorten my attention span, affecting my academic and personal growth. My experience might be relatable to others, I want to explore into mental health using data science, analyzing and predicting trends as this project allow me explore in this field further.
